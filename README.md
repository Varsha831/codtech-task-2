Overview of the Project
This project involves implementing a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable using a dataset. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization to assess the model's performance. It aims to demonstrate the practical application of linear regression for predictive analytics.

Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Predict Continuous Variables: Use linear regression to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target).
Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to understand how well the model fits the data.
Visualize Results: Provide visualizations that help interpret the results, including the regression line and comparisons between actual and predicted values.
